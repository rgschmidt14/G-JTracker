# G-JTracker

Comprehensive Outline: Expanding the Single-File G&J Tracker into a Full Multi-File Application
Below is a start-to-finish roadmap to transform the single-file HTML app I provided into a robust, multi-file web application. This outline assumes you're starting with the code from my previous response (the index.html file with embedded CSS/JS). We'll break it into multiple files for better organization, scalability, and maintainability—using modular JS (ES modules), separate CSS, and potentially additional libraries via CDNs where needed. The end result will fully implement everything you've requested across our conversations:

Core Features: Items (skills/faculties/factors) with tiers (auto-calculated, exactly 2 parents for tier 1+), levels 0-7 (F-Z grades, with checklists for pass-off/proof, editable progress in notebook/RPG), descriptions/notes/journals (markdown via marked.js), history for evolutions.
Evolution System: "Innovate" shifts checklists down (e.g., level 5 -> 4, making room for new boundaries), with logs; Z/7 unfathomable (auto-bump fathomable to S/6, with prompts like "Is this divine insight? 🌞").
Loose Ends Discovery: Detection (non-2-parent tier1+, childless non-primes), suggestions (rule-based decomposition), dedicated view/filter.
Notebook Mode: Personal tracking with goals (target levels/dues), journals (per-item markdown logs), reminders (simple JS alerts on load), progress bars, PDF exports (jsPDF for printable checklists/worksheets).
RPG Mode: Characters/parties (shared prereqs/items), acquisition with prereq checks, enhancements (S/6 for magic/drugs with warnings: "Drugs ruin lives—use for story only!"), XP costs for levels (configurable), temp boosts (e.g., spells for fox form 🦊 or super flight 🪶).
Reference Mode: Sorted index, mind-map view (add vis.js for graphs), search with advanced filters (type/tier/level/loose ends).
Data Handling: LocalStorage persistence; CSV/JSON import/export (via Papa.parse; no duplicates—merge by id/name, add new on top); validation (e.g., enforce rules, handle large AI-generated inputs).
UI/Polish: Themes (light/dark, orange accents 🧡), responsive (mobile for on-the-go 🛩️), keyboard shortcuts, accessibility (ARIA), uplifting tone (pride in A/S/Z: "True excellence pushing limits! 🧀"), emoji integrations (e.g., badges for your interests like 🦝 for story chars).
Scalability: Handle 1000+ items (paginate searches, lazy-load trees); no internet (all local/offline).

Tech Stack Updates:

HTML/JS/CSS (core).
CDNs: marked.js (markdown), Papa.parse (CSV), jsPDF (PDFs), vis.js (graphs in reference).
Structure: Root folder with index.html, styles/ (CSS), scripts/ (JS modules), assets/ (icons/emojis if needed).
Build: No build tools needed (plain JS); for production, optional minification.

Total Estimated Time: 3-6 weeks part-time (assuming basic web dev skills). Phases include milestones for testing. Use Git for versioning.
Phase 1: Restructure into Multi-File Setup (1-2 days)

Goal: Split the single file without breaking functionality; modularize for expansions.
Steps:

File Breakdown:

index.html: Core HTML skeleton (header, nav, panes, modal). Remove embedded CSS/JS; link externals.
styles/main.css: All CSS (variables, responsive, cards, modal—copy from previous).
scripts/app.js: Main entry (init, event listeners, render functions—import modules).
scripts/data.js: Data model, load/save, helpers (getItem, updateTiers, findLooseEnds, canAcquire).
scripts/ui.js: Rendering funcs (createItemCard, render views, searchResults).
scripts/modal.js: Open/close modal, form handling (add/edit, validation).
scripts/importExport.js: CSV/JSON handlers (handleCSVImport, exportCSV, etc.; merge logic: if existing, update fields like checklists/descriptions).
scripts/utils.js: Misc (getLevelGrade, applyTheme, toggleTheme).


Modularization: Use ES modules (export function ...; import { func } from './data.js';).
Dependencies: Add CDNs to index.html head (Papa.parse already there; add jsPDF: <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/2.5.1/jspdf.umd.min.js"></script>, vis.js: <script src="https://unpkg.com/vis-network/standalone/umd/vis-network.min.js"></script>).
Duplicate Handling in Imports: In importExport.js, for each imported row/item: const existing = gameData.items.find(i => i.id === row.id || i.name.toLowerCase() === row.name.toLowerCase()); if (existing) { Object.assign(existing, rowParsed); } else { gameData.items.push(rowParsed); } updateTiers();.


Milestone: App runs as before but from multiple files; test import CSV with merges (no dups).

Phase 2: Enhance Core Item Management (2-3 days)

Goal: Full CRUD with your rules; integrate levels/checklists/evolutions.
Steps:

Update Data Model (data.js): Add isPrime auto-set, enhanced flag for S/6+.
Modal Form (modal.js): Tabs for checklists 1-7 (textareas parsing "- Task" to arrays); parent selects (dynamic populate from items); validation (2 parents for tier1+, level caps with Z prompt: if (level > 5 && !enhanced) confirm('Enhanced?'); if (level === 7) if (confirm('Fathomable?')) level = 6;).
Card Rendering (ui.js): Expand checklists with editable checkboxes (if in notebook/RPG; track progress per-char); add "Evolve" button calling evolveItem (shift checklists down, log history).
Level Progression: In data.js, incrementLevel(id, charId=null): Check prereqs, bump level if checklists complete; cap at 5 unless enhanced.


Milestone: Add/edit item with checklists; evolve a sample (e.g., "Pots" faculty: shift level 5 to 4); view graded levels (F-A-S-Z).

Phase 3: Implement Views and Search (3-4 days)

Goal: Tabbed navigation with full features.
Steps:

DB View (ui.js): Tree rendering (use vis.js for graphs: nodes/items, edges/parents; vertical/horizontal toggle).
Reference View: Sorted list (by name/tier); loose ends section with suggestions (e.g., "Decompose into [factor like 'Manual Dexterity'] + [related skill]"—hardcode rules or simple string match).
Search/Filters (ui.js): Add level/tier ranges; "Loose Ends" checkbox filters via findLooseEnds().
Focal Item: Click search result renders full card with children/parents trees.


Milestone: Search/filter loose ends; view graph in DB; get decomposition suggestions.

Phase 4: Notebook Mode Integration (3-4 days)

Goal: Personal self-improvement tracking.
Steps:

Notebook Tab (ui.js): List "Me" chars (create if none); render sheets with progress bars (<div style="width: ${ (level/7)*100 }%"></div>).
Goals/Journals (data.js): Add to chars: goals: [{itemId, targetLevel, due}]; render with reminders (on load: if due < today, alert "Practice Flying! 🛩️").
Pass-Off: Checkbox events update progress, auto-level up.
Exports (importExport.js): Add PDF (jsPDF: doc.addPage(); doc.text('Checklist for ' + name); for each task: doc.text('- ' + task); doc.save('notebook.pdf')).


Milestone: Set goal for "Animal Care" level 3 🐾; log journal; export PDF worksheet; get reminder alert.

Phase 5: RPG Mode Integration (3-4 days)

Goal: Character/party building with enhancements.
Steps:

RPG Tab (ui.js): Create/edit chars/parties; acquisition buttons (call acquireItem with prereq check).
Enhancements (data.js): Toggle enhanced for S/6+ (warn for drugs: alert("Drugs ruin lives—story only!"); allow magic like "Fox Form Spell 🦊").
XP System: Add xpCost per level (e.g., level * 10); track char XP, spend on increments.
Parties: Shared items (acquire once for all chars); temp boosts (set timer: setTimeout(() => decrementLevel(), duration)).


Milestone: Build party with raccoon dog char 🦝; acquire enhanced stealth (S-tier); spend XP.

Phase 6: Advanced Features and Polish (4-5 days)

Goal: Tie in all extras; optimize.
Steps:

Discovery Enhancements: In reference, "Suggest" button: Basic rules (e.g., if childless skill, suggest adding 2 children based on primes).
Keyboard Shortcuts: In app.js: document.addEventListener('keydown', e => { if (e.ctrlKey && e.key === 'n') openModal('create'); });.
Themes/Emojis: Add user prefs; badge items with your emojis (e.g., if name includes "fox", add 🦊).
Scalability: Paginate results (slice(page*20, (page+1)*20)); web workers for tier updates if large.
In-App Docs: Modal with your level explanations (e.g., "A means pushing limits—pride in excellence! 🧀🌞").
Testing/Edge Cases: Validate Z (unfathomable prompt); handle large CSV (chunk imports); faith ties (optional "Divine Unlock" for Z).


Milestone: Full test: AI-generate CSV for 100 items (no dups), evolve, discover loose ends, notebook for pilot goals 📚🛩️, RPG with animal love party 🐾🦄.

Final Deployment Notes

Host locally or on GitHub Pages/Netlify (free).
Future: Add PWA for offline (manifest.json); server if collab needed.
If tweaks: E.g., global vs per-char evolutions (make configurable).

This turns your app into the beast you envision—let's build! If phase 1 files needed as code, say so. 🧡🦝🐾🛩️🧀
